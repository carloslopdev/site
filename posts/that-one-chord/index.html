That sense of discovery tinged with a little fear. Imagine stumbling through woods and finding an abandoned cabin.</p><p>Pushing the door open, you see an old piano. You&rsquo;d heard one of those on a recording, but this was real. You knew the magic it holded. But your fingers were strangers to those yellowed keys.</p><p>Yet, you came back. Day after day. You&rsquo;d sit on the bench, the silence of the cabin pressing in, and just hit the keys. Thumping noises and awkward, disjointed sounds. Frustration shouting into a void.</p><p>But you kept returning. Maybe it was the quiet, maybe the weirdness of it. Your hands moved, searching blindly.</p><p>Then, one afternoon, it happened without thought. Not a single note, but three. Your hand, almost of its own accord, pressed down – thump – but this time&mldr; it wasn&rsquo;t noise. It was a sound. A deep, resonant chord that hung in the air of the old cabin, richer and fuller than anything you&rsquo;d made before. It vibrated in your chest.</p><p>You froze. You lifted your hand, hesitant, then pressed those same three keys again. There. It bloomed again. Solid. Intentional. Right.</p><p>Something shifted. Not in the piano, but in you. The next notes felt like choices. Patterns emerging from chaos, faint trails you could follow. The overwhelming confusion, the not-knowing. You hadn&rsquo;t mastered it, not even close. But you found a foothold.</p><p>Life feels like that. We are drawn by possibility. Making meaningless noises, we keep showing up, pressing keys we don&rsquo;t understand.</p><p>And then, one day, you find it. We strike a chord, the first real sound. The confirmation that confusion wasn&rsquo;t pointless, it was the path.</p><p>Now you&rsquo;re starting to play.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer><img src=../../img/logo.png alt=Logo class=logo-footer></footer></body></html>
