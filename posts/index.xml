That sense of discovery tinged with a little fear. Imagine stumbling through woods and finding an abandoned cabin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pushing the door open, you see an old piano. You&amp;rsquo;d heard one of those on a recording, but this was real. You knew the magic it holded. But your fingers were strangers to those yellowed keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, you came back. Day after day. You&amp;rsquo;d sit on the bench, the silence of the cabin pressing in, and just hit the keys. Thumping noises and awkward, disjointed sounds.

Oh no, what will become of me?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coordinates</title><link>https://carlos.bz/posts/coordinates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/posts/coordinates/</guid><description>&lt;p>It could be any ordinary Saturday at the beginning of the year. Itâ€™s 10:34 PM, and Iâ€™m playing my PS5 in the living room with the volume low and a blanket draped over me. I glance around and see shelves filled with books and vinyl records, and nearby, on the dining table, my two black cats resting peacefully. One of them comes to curl up on my lap while I play, and his brother, the shyer one, follows suit a few minutes later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello</title><link>https://carlos.bz/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/posts/hello/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re liking my website.&lt;/p>
