Ever.</p><p>In the past, there were some periods (weeks/months) when I tried being active on social media, just to see if I could get something positive out of it. Who knows? No. Mistake. It didn’t work out that way. It was a disaster. It’s not for me.</p><p>I felt completely manipulated and overwhelmed, stuck in a cycle I didn’t want to be part of. On top of that, I considered it a complete waste of time, even counterproductive, since it can feed into your insecurities. Am I getting fewer likes? Oh no, what will become of me?</p><p>I reaffirmed that I didn’t enjoy feeling exposed or broadcasting my life for others to consume.The time I save is also significant, allowing me to focus on activities I find more productive.</p><p>Of course, there are certain topics I’m very interested in and want to stay updated on. That’s why I changed my information consumption habits and subscribed to a few newsletters that summarize the latest news on those topics in convenient doses. I can quickly check my inbox whenever I feel like it.</p><p>This was also part of the motivation for creating this website. It gives me total control over my information, far removed from the instant gratification industry. Free of likes, notifications, FOMO, data mining, and dark patterns.</p><p>I prefer to cultivate a lifestyle where I continue learning to ignore the noise and maintain my peace of mind.</p></div></article></div></div></main><footer><img src=../../img/logo.png alt=Logo class=logo-footer></footer></body></html>
