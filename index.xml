That sense of discovery tinged with a little fear. Imagine stumbling through woods and finding an abandoned cabin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pushing the door open, you see an old piano. You&amp;rsquo;d heard one of those on a recording, but this was real. You knew the magic it holded. But your fingers were strangers to those yellowed keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, you came back. Day after day. You&amp;rsquo;d sit on the bench, the silence of the cabin pressing in, and just hit the keys. Thumping noises and awkward, disjointed sounds. Frustration shouting into a void.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3</title><link>https://carlos.bz/bits/3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/bits/3/</guid><description>&lt;p>reading &lt;strong>the pragmatic programmer&lt;/strong> after 10 years working in startups feels like a constant dÃ©jÃ  vu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On social media</title><link>https://carlos.bz/posts/on-social-media/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/posts/on-social-media/</guid><description>&lt;p>I donâ€™t do social media. Ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past, there were some periods (weeks/months) when I tried being active on social media, just to see if I could get something positive out of it. Who knows? No. Mistake. It didnâ€™t work out that way. It was a disaster. Itâ€™s not for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt completely manipulated and overwhelmed, stuck in a cycle I didnâ€™t want to be part of. On top of that, I considered it a complete waste of time, even counterproductive, since it can feed into your insecurities. Am I getting fewer likes? Oh no, what will become of me?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cats</title><link>https://carlos.bz/photos/cats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/photos/cats/</guid><description>&lt;img src="./photos/cats.jpg" title="Kirla &amp; Lenko" class="photo" /></description></item><item><title>2</title><link>https://carlos.bz/bits/2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/bits/2/</guid><description>&lt;p>tinykin is hands-down the most satisfying and cozy gaming experience i&amp;rsquo;ve had in the last few years. totally recommended. i even got all the trophies.&lt;/p>

Itâ€™s 10:34 PM, and Iâ€™m playing my PS5 in the living room with the volume low and a blanket draped over me. I glance around and see shelves filled with books and vinyl records, and nearby, on the dining table, my two black cats resting peacefully. One of them comes to curl up on my lap while I play, and his brother, the shyer one, follows suit a few minutes later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rome</title><link>https://carlos.bz/photos/rome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/photos/rome/</guid><description>&lt;img src="./photos/rome.jpg" title="Rome" class="photo" /></description></item><item><title>Hello</title><link>https://carlos.bz/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlos.bz/posts/hello/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re liking my website.&lt;/p>
